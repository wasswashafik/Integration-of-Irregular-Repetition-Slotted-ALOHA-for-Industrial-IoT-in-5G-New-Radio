The resimulated code used in the paper "System Level Integration of Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA for Industrial IoT in 5G New Radio" by H. Murat GÃ¼rsu, M. Cagatay Moroglu, Mikhail Vilgelm, Federico Clazzer, Wolfgang Kellerer for the PIMRC 2019 Istanbul.

Firstly we explain the re-used code.

IRSA algorithm is taken from https://github.com/afcuttin/irsa, which includes 
the files: LICENSE, generateTwins.m, irsa.m, sampleIrsaScript.m and sic.m.

Functions:

- irsa.m calculates the normalized load,the normalized throughput and packet loss 
Rate by using single channel, with given parameters "sourceNumber, randomAccessFrameLength, packetReadyProb, maxRepetitionRate, simulationTime, maxIter".
Note: We updated this function by adding two more degree distribution.

- GenerateTwins.m return the MAC frame includes twins.

- sic.m makes successive interference cancelation, and returns MAC frame with unsolved packets, solved users, and solved packets information.

Scripts:

- sampleIrsaScript.m is a sample script for IRSA.

Secondly the following introduces the simulator we developped for NR integration. The flow chart introduces introduction of each function.

![Function Flow Chart](https://github.com/tum-lkn/IRSA_4_5G/blob/master/FlowChart.jpg)


Functions:

- multichannelIRSA.c: In this function, each user randomly selects a channel out of ChannelNumber usable channels. The IRSA simulation is run for each channel separately. The performance metrics from all channels are averaged over all channels.

- irsa_beta.m: This function investigates the time based behavior of arrivals for MC-IRSA. At each time instant it uses multichannelIRSA.c to simulate multiple channel IRSA during the period of one multichannel IRSA-frame. The beta distribution used in sumulations is based on the reference [21] in the manuscript. This distribution is discretized with a selected time step. Lastly, the average normalized Load, normalized Throughput, and PLR vectors are calculated over different time-instances. FIXED number of channels is used throughout the simulation. 


- irsa_poisson.m: This function is same as irsa_beta.m but using Poisson distribution instead of Beta distribution.


- optimize_numberOfChannel.m: This function calculates the optimum number of channel for a given number of users, randomAccessFrameLength, and degree distribution under the constraints of maxChannelNumber and Packet Loss Rate of 0.1 for MC-IRSA.

- optimize_numberOfChannel_2.m: This function is similar to the function "optimize_numberOfChannel.m". This function is for for AMC-IRSA.

- irsa_beta_different_channel.m: This function investigates the time based behavior of arrivals for AMC-IRSA. At each time instant it uses multichannelIRSA.c to simulate multiple channel IRSA during the period of one multichannel IRSA-frame. The beta distribution used in sumulations is based on the reference [21] in the manuscript. This distribution is discretized with a selected time step. Lastly, the average normalized Load, normalized Throughput, and PLR vectors are calculated over different time-instances. FIXED number of channels is used throughout the simulation. 

Scripts:

- Multichannel.m: A sample script to run the function "multichannelIRSA.m", which gives the change in the performance metrics by increasing number of channel.

- Beta_dist.m: This is a sample script to calculate the performance of IRSA with the Beta distribution with the help of function "irsa_beta.m", which uses the fixed number of channel throughout the whole simulation time.

- ComparisonBetawithPoisson.m: This is a sample script to compare the performance of IRSA with fixed channel number throughout 10 second between Beta and Poisson distribution. The distributions have same loads.

- Beta_diff_channel.m: A script to run the function "irsa_beta_different_channel.m" with different Random Access Frame Lengths and different discrete time-step lengths. Remember: irsa_beta_different_channel.m function uses optimum channel number in each discrete time-step.

- Beta_diff_channel2.m: A script to run the function "irsa_beta_different_channel.m" with  different discrete step-size and different subcarrier spacing. In 5G, allowed subcarrier spacing is limeted with 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 kHZ. In the paper, we defined latency = waiting time + 2*frame length. We assumed the waiting time is constant and equal to zero for all subcarrier spacings to have a good comprasion. Then, we find the random access frame length based on different subcarrier spacings under the constaint that all systems use same amount of resources. 

- Direct_Beta_scr.m: A sample script to run the function "Direct_Beta.m", which calculate the performance of IRSA with an exact Beta distribution.
